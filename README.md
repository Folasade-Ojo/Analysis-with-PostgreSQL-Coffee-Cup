# Coffee-Cup
## Dataset
The dataset employed for this project comprises 4250 records, each with 20 distinct attributes. These attributes include both numerical and categorical data. The dataset encompasses performance metrics accumulated by the coffee cup company from 2018 to 2019, among other performance metrics.

According to the dataset, the coffee cup company has 102 stores in different cities across the regions in Canada. Additionally, the company deals in 12 different products. Their mission statement is :***“To provide the world’s ultimate coffee shop experience with the highest-quality products, most: to have inviting stores, friendliest staff and best value.”***

The objective of this project is to provide insightful answers to key business questions through the use of interactive Tableau dashboards. Additionally, the project aims to develop a strategy map that aligns with the company's vision and mission statement.

## Analysis
The dataset underwent a thorough profiling process to ensure accuracy, completeness, and uniformity. Despite initial visual inspection indicating a clean dataset, further analysis utilizing techniques such as comparison and matching with publicly available information, identification of spelling errors, and consistency checks between records across different columns revealed the presence of errors. To rectify these errors, data cleaning was performed utilizing PostgreSQL due to its user-friendly and straightforward functionality.

With Tableau, I utilized calculated fields, parameters, actions, etc. to create visuals which answer below questions:

- Which store is the most profitable store (net profit)?
* Which products should be dropped and why?
+ Which products should be added and why?
- What is the performance by region?
* Is the company growing versus the previous year?
